"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means the two copies have drifted.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/plugin.js` holds the five GLSL strings of `source/Shaders.cpp` -- the
version line, the vertex body and the capture, resample and output bodies --
and the numbers the projector and the print are made of. That is two copies of
the same text, and two copies drift quietly: a demo that renders a *plausible*
flickering, weaving, scratched print looks exactly like one that renders the
right one. The page's claim is that the gate, the print and the shutter's sum
running in your browser are the plugin's, so the claim needs something
enforcing it. `gatest` drives the real plugin class and has never heard of this
page.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

1. Pulls each `R"( ... )"` body out of Shaders.cpp and each matching backtick
   literal out of plugin.js, and compares them exactly -- no whitespace
   normalisation, no comment stripping. A comment updated on one side only is
   drift worth catching; the comments carry the reasoning (why the bilinear is
   written out, why the scratches are in the gate).

   The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation. A template literal
   cannot hold a raw backtick, backslash or `${`, so `sync_shaders.py` escapes
   those three; this undoes exactly those three and REJECTS any other backslash
   on the JS side, which could only be somebody hiding a difference in the
   decoder.

2. Regenerates the rest of the generated block -- Shaders.h's print-data layout,
   every constant of Model.h, the control counts, option lists, frame rates and
   lamp temperatures -- from the C++ and compares it with plugin.js, line for
   line.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

Nothing here checks the PORT. The hash, `CumulativeOpen` and `Segments`, the
weave, `Scratches`, `Dust`, `HairAt`, the splices and cues, `Retention`,
`LampRgb`, every control's law, and Gate::ProcessOpenGL's clock, hold, print
upload and uniforms in plugin.js are a hand translation of Model.cpp,
Controls.cpp and Gate.cpp, and only a reader can tell whether they still agree.
Change one of those and change the page by hand to match.

If this fails because a shader changed in the plugin: `python3 demo/tools/sync_shaders.py`,
never an edit of plugin.js by hand.
